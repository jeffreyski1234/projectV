# projectV
Readme

One major modification is that spring framework and the springtestcontroller code was added to demonstrate spring in its entirety but is not necessary for functional project.
Student was changed to student2 in all places.
StudentsList is Student2List to avoid conflict with working code.

SpringTest can be accessed at http://[local web url]/examapp/student2index.jsp and will function perfectly.
